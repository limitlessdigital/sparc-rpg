#### Insights Discovered:
- SPARC's mechanics aren't the problem - it's the bridge between sitting down and taking meaningful action
- New Seers need "I've got this covered" confidence more than rule memorization
- First-5-minutes experience determines whether players return for session 2
- Experienced players will stay engaged if story compensates for mechanical simplicity
- "What success looks like" understanding must precede dice mechanics learning

#### Notable Connections:
- Beginner action clarity connects to Seer confidence tools
- Seer AI assistance directly addresses experienced player story depth needs
- Cognitive offloading benefits both new Seers and overwhelmed beginners
- All three perspectives share need for "safety net" feeling
