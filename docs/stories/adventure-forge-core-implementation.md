## Dev Notes
This story implements the foundational Adventure Forge system. Focus on:
1. **Canvas performance** - Virtual rendering for large adventures
2. **Type safety** - Strict TypeScript interfaces for all node types  
3. **Mobile optimization** - Touch-first design approach
4. **State management** - Complex adventure state tracking
5. **Validation** - Prevent broken adventures from being published

Reference the component specifications in `/docs/architecture/component-specifications.md` for detailed implementation requirements.

## Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Individual node types, connection logic, validation rules
- **Integration Tests:** Canvas interactions, node creation flows, adventure export
- **E2E Tests:** Complete adventure creation workflow using Naigonn Chapel
- **Performance Tests:** 100+ node stress testing, mobile device testing
